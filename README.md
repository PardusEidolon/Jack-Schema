# Hello There.

This is small project to help understand the process of embedding structured data into a hugo
website. I dont expect this to be here for long and I aslo expect it to be updated before I move 
onto the real deal.

I'm just here trying to learn schema.org and combining that with the Open Graph protocol, and 
Twitter cards. Here's a rough outline of what I'm going to do.

\* Start Off with Two events

\* Gather Two Images, Videos and Documents

\* Name and put together appropriate item props

**I will also put down a description of Schema for reference so I dont get lost:**

Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.


Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.


Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process, using the public-schemaorg@w3.org mailing list and through GitHub.


A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts. It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
